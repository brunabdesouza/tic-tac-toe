# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

This was my first project in the SEI course, I had to create a Tic Tac Toe game.

## My Tic Tac Toe Game

https://brunabdesouza.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

## Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery to build this game.

## How to play/features

The game has a restart button that resets the game but you keep your score until you reload the page and start a new game.  

## Known Bugs

There are a few things that will need to be improved before the project is complete.
* Before you start the game, you should be able to select which player you want to be i.e. X or O.
* The board on the screen doesn't move when the screen is smaller so you can't see it.
The plan is to add this feature and fix this css problem as soon as possible.

## Future feature/Wishlist

* Select what player someone wants to be.
* Create an AI opponent

## My experience developing the game

Having started the SEI course only two weeks ago and having no prior experience using any of the technologies I've used to build this game, I felt this project was very challenging and I have learned a lot from them.
